#       - Get a Better View Distance, By LXCT. -
#=======================================================
# (Don't change Performances unless You Know what you're doing !)
# Need some help to config ?
# Read this :
#
#
# Version: 1.1 # Version of the config file. DON'T TOUCH THIS
# ViewDistance:
#   Min: 4 # Min View Distance. Keep it above 4.
#   Max: 16 # Max View Distance. Player can't get above 32.
#   AFK : 3 # View Distance of "AFK" players. You can't assign a value less than 3.
#   OnLogin: 4 # View Distance assigned on login. I advise you to set the same value as Min
#   OnTeleport: 4 # View distance when the player teleport himself (I suggest you to keep this value between 3 and 8) Reduce bandwidth lags
#   UnsetTeleportViewDelay: 5 # Delay in seconds to unset OnTeleport view when teleport.
#   CalculationDelay: 1 # Delay between ASYNC calculations. Keep it above 1. NEED RESTART, DOES NOT AFFECT PERFORMANCES.
#   SetViewDelay: 15 # Delay between applying calculations. Keep it above 5. A little number will make view distance change faster. NEED RESTART, AFFECT PERFORMANCES.
# Performances:
#   PingForReduction: 1000 # If your ping is higher than this value, then your view distance will be reduced. Keep it above 400.
#   PingForAugmentation: 90 # If your ping is less than this value, then your view distance will be increased. Keep it below 100.
#   TPSLimit: 19.5 # If the tps are above this value, the ReductionIndice is reduced. If the tps are below this value, the ReductionIndice will increase.
#   TPSChangeIndice: 0.01 # How much the reduction indice will be decreased/increased par calculations. Keep this value between 0.1 and 0.01 (10% and 1%) 0.05 = 5%
#   MaxReductionIndice: 0.75 # Maximum value of the reduction indice.
#   AFKTimer : 90 # Seconds before getting "AFK" and get his view distance reduced to "Min" value. Keep this value over 60. (Doesn't affect gameplay)
# Other:
#   HideVdistLine4: false # Hide vdist.line4 (in messages.yml) when players uses /vdist
#   CheckUpdate: true # You should keep this to true. It check if your plugins version is the latest. THIS DOES NOT IMPACT PERFORMANCES, NEED RESTART
#   Metrics: true # Please keep this to true. Metrics is anonymous and it helps developers stay motivated. THIS DOES NOT IMPACT PERFORMANCES, NEED RESTART
#   SafePing: 1 # Minimum ping required for calculations. Set it to 0 or -1 for local hosting. Keep this value below 1
#
#
#
# Please restart your server the first time you're using this plugin. Don't reload.
